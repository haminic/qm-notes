# Quantum Mechanics Notes

## â–¸ About ðŸ“–

This repository contains the source code of my personal notes (in Thai) on **Quantum Mechanics**, written in $\LaTeX$. These notes are a product of my study of *"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"* by David J. Griffiths, supplemented with other materials I see fit. I've also included the compiled PDF file [here](main.pdf) for ease of access, but note that it may not always be the most up-to-date version.

These notes are a **work in progress** and meant for **personal use**, so it is *very* incomplete and may contain errors, omissions, or unclear explanations. Please donâ€™t rely on them as an authoritative source (in fact, right now I've only written quite little content).

This repository is public only for convenience, so I'd prefer it not be forked. If youâ€™d like to suggest improvements or corrections and you know me, feel free to reach out.

## â–¸ Credits ðŸ’³

A big thanks to Evan Chen for inspiring much of my preamble and formatting. Parts of my preamble are adapted from his [`evan.sty`](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty). The preamble is currently in a separate private repository, but you can still see the older parts of it in previous commits.

## â–¸ References ðŸ”Ž

The notes are primarily based on *"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"* by David J. Griffiths, along with additional material from other textbooks. The referenced textbooks are listed (in no specific order) below:
